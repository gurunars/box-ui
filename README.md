# Android CRUD UI

A collection of modules aiming to simplify creation of very specific simple
CRUD apps for Android that require several capabilities:

- creating and editing items via individual item type specific forms
- manipulating the lists of items via a set of controls
- customizing list item rendering by associating types with type specific
  renderers
- managing look and feel of the creation menu

The project is split into multiple reusable modules that can be employed on
their own.

Meant for Kotlin.

NOTE: the project has a very opinionated set of constraints that guarantees
that simple CRUD apps can be created with as little cognitive effort as
possible.
